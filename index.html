    <h1>Info About the Famous Watch Company,Rolex</h1>
    
    <p><em>Rolex</em> SA and its subsidiary Montres Tudor SA design, manufacture, distribute and service wristwatches sold under the <em>Rolex</em> and Tudor brands. Founded by Hans Wilsdorf and <strong>Alfred Davis</strong> in London, England in 1905 as <strong>Wilsdorf and Davis</strong>, <em>Rolex</em> moved its base of operations to Geneva, <em>Switzerland</em> in 1919.</p>

    <h2>Automatic movements</h2>
    
    <p>The <em>first self-winding Rolex wristwatch</em> was offered to the public in <strong>1931</strong> (so-called the <em>"bubbleback"</em> due to the large caseback), preceded to the market by <strong>Harwood</strong> which patented the design in <strong>1923</strong> and produced the first self-winding watch in <strong>1928</strong>, powered by an internal mechanism that used the movement of the wearer's arm. This not only made watch-winding unnecessary, but kept the power from the mainspring more consistent resulting in more reliable time keeping.</p>

    <h2>Quartz movements</h2>
    
    <p><em>Rolex</em> participated in the development of the original <em>quartz</em> watch movements. Although Rolex has made very few <em>quartz</em> models for its <strong>Oyster</strong> line, the company's engineers were instrumental in design and implementation of the technology during the late <strong>1960s and early 1970s</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>In <strong>1968</strong>, <em>Rolex</em> collaborated with a consortium of 16 Swiss watch manufacturers to develop the Beta 21 <em>quartz</em> movement used in their <em>Rolex</em> <em>Quartz</em> Date 5100. Within about five years of research, design, and development, Rolex created the "clean-slate" 5035/5055 movement that would eventually power the <em>Rolex Oysterquartz</em>.</p>

    <h2>Certified chronometers</h2>    
    
    <p><em>Rolex</em> is the largest manufacturer of <em>Swiss</em> made certified <em>chronometers</em>. In <strong>2005</strong>, more than half the annual production of COSC certified watches were <em>Rolexes</em>.</p>
    
    <p>To date, <em>Rolex</em> still holds the record for the most certified chronometer movements in the category of wristwatches.</p>
